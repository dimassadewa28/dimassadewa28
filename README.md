## Computer Science Focus

I am building a strong foundation in systems, algorithms, and security — prioritizing understanding over surface-level tool usage.

### Current Technical Focus
- Data structures & algorithmic problem solving
- Operating system fundamentals (processes, memory, scheduling)
- Computer networking basics (TCP/IP, HTTP, system communication)
- Security principles and system-level vulnerabilities

### Approach
- Study concepts deeply before relying on frameworks
- Break systems down to understand how they fail and how they work
- Practice through structured exercises and controlled experiments

### Direction
Develop strong system-level competence with a security-oriented mindset.
